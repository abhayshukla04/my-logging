Observability : why we need IT system to be observable ?
1. We need to discover problems in it system, infra, application
2. Need to be able to fix problem, when they discovered, efficiently
3. would like to understand system, how multile system work together, by seeing logs, metrics, 
4. Audit : who, when , why, 
5. Reporting : what happen last months, stats : daily, monthly, yearly
6. Forecasting : ex.: how many users/infra, we have now, how many user/infra we are expecting in next months
